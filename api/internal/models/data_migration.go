// DataMigration records a one-time data migration that has been applied, so it
// is not re-run on subsequent startups. It is distinct from the GORM schema
// AutoMigrate handled by repositories.MakeMigrations: this ledger tracks
// one-off transformations of existing rows.
//
// It deliberately does not embed BaseModel — a soft-deleted row would be hidden
// by GORM's default scope and cause the migration to re-run.
